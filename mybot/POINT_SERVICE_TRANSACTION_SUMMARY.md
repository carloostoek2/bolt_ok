# PointService with PointTransaction Implementation - Summary

## Overview
This implementation refactors the PointService to use PointTransaction for complete audit trails of all point operations while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing services.

## Files Modified/Added

### New Files
1. `database/transaction_models.py` - Added PointTransaction model
2. `migrations/001_point_transaction_schema.sql` - Database migration script
3. `tests/services/test_point_service_transaction.py` - Unit tests for transaction functionality
4. `tests/integration/test_point_service_integration.py` - Integration tests with existing services
5. `docs/point_service_transaction.md` - Documentation

### Modified Files
1. `database/__init__.py` - Added PointTransaction to exports
2. `database/models.py` - Removed redundant `last_notified_points` field from UserStats
3. `database/narrative_models.py` - Removed redundant `total_besitos_earned` field from UserNarrativeState
4. `services/point_service.py` - Refactored to use PointTransaction internally

## Key Features

### 1. PointTransaction Model
- Tracks all point operations with full audit trail
- Records user_id, amount, balance_after, source, and description
- Automatically created for every point addition/deduction

### 2. Refactored PointService
- Internal operations now create PointTransaction records
- Public interface remains unchanged for backward compatibility
- Added new `get_transaction_history()` method for audit trails
- Added new `get_balance()` method as an alias for existing functionality

### 3. Removed Redundant Fields
- Removed `UserStats.last_notified_points` (now calculated from transactions)
- Removed `UserNarrativeState.total_besitos_earned` (redundant with User.points)

## Backward Compatibility
All existing methods maintain their exact signatures:
- `add_points(user_id, points, *, bot=None, skip_notification=False)`
- `deduct_points(user_id, points)`
- `get_user_points(user_id)`
- `get_top_users(limit=10)`
- `award_message(user_id, bot)`
- `award_reaction(user, message_id, bot)`
- `award_poll(user_id, bot)`
- `daily_checkin(user_id, bot)`

Services using PointService do not require any changes.

## Testing
- 6 unit tests for transaction functionality
- 3 integration tests with existing services
- All tests passing

## Database Migration
The migration script creates the new `point_transactions` table with appropriate indexes.
The removed columns from `user_stats` and `user_narrative_states` are handled by simply ignoring them in the ORM - no destructive migration is required.
