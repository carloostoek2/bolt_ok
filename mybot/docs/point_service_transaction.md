# PointService with PointTransaction Implementation

## Overview

The PointService has been refactored to use PointTransaction for complete audit trails of all point operations while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing services.

## Key Changes

### 1. PointTransaction Model
- Added new `PointTransaction` model to track all point operations
- Records user_id, amount, balance_after, source, and description
- Automatically created for every point addition/deduction

### 2. Refactored PointService
- Internal operations now create PointTransaction records
- Public interface remains unchanged for backward compatibility
- Added new `get_transaction_history()` method for audit trails
- Added new `get_balance()` method as an alias for existing functionality

### 3. Removed Redundant Fields
- Removed `UserStats.last_notified_points` (now calculated from transactions)
- Removed `UserNarrativeState.total_besitos_earned` (redundant with User.points)

## New Functionality

### Transaction History
```python
# Get complete transaction history for a user
transactions = await point_service.get_transaction_history(user_id)
```

### Balance Retrieval
```python
# Get current user balance (same as existing get_user_points)
balance = await point_service.get_balance(user_id)
```

## Backward Compatibility

All existing methods maintain their exact signatures:
- `add_points(user_id, points, *, bot=None, skip_notification=False)`
- `deduct_points(user_id, points)`
- `get_user_points(user_id)`
- `get_top_users(limit=10)`
- `award_message(user_id, bot)`
- `award_reaction(user, message_id, bot)`
- `award_poll(user_id, bot)`
- `daily_checkin(user_id, bot)`

Services using PointService do not require any changes.

## Database Migration

The migration script `migrations/001_point_transaction_schema.sql` creates the new `point_transactions` table with appropriate indexes.

The removed columns from `user_stats` and `user_narrative_states` are handled by simply ignoring them in the ORM - no destructive migration is required.

## Testing

New test files have been added:
- `tests/services/test_point_service_transaction.py` - Unit tests for transaction functionality
- `tests/integration/test_point_service_integration.py` - Integration tests with existing services
