# database_models provides the database schema definition.
#
# This module defines the SQLAlchemy models for the bot's database.
#
# Basic usage:
#
#   from database.models import User
#   new_user = User(id=123, username='test')
#
# The module defines the structure of the data stored by the bot.
# It uses SQLAlchemy's declarative base to define the models. N/A to error handling and thread safety.
#
# For configuration, see the database setup.
