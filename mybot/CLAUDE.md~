This documentation should be updated as new features are added or architectural changes are made to the system.
- than 100KB
Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase
Important Notes

Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
